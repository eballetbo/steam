# Designing Montessori Number Blocks with Inkscape: A Step-by-Step Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of creating the design files for Montessori Number Blocks (also known as Number Rods or Number Blocks Bricks) using Inkscape, a free and open-source vector graphics editor. These blocks are a fundamental material in Montessori education for teaching basic math concepts.

## Prerequisites

* **Inkscape:** Make sure you have Inkscape installed on your computer. You can download it for free from [https://inkscape.org/](https://inkscape.org/).
* **Basic Inkscape Knowledge:** This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Inkscape's interface and tools (e.g., creating shapes, using the alignment tool).
* **Measurements:** You need to know the desired dimensions for your Number Blocks. Common dimensions are:
  * **Width and Depth:** Usually square, e.g., 2cm x 2cm.
  * **Length:** Varies from 2cm (for block 1) to 20cm (for block 10) if using a 2cm base, or 2,5 cm (for block 1) to 25cm (for block 10) if using a 2,5cm base.
* **Material thickness:** Decide the material thickness you will use (e.g., 3mm, 6mm, 15mm). Use thick wood if you want to stack them.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Setting Up the Document

1. **Open Inkscape:** Launch Inkscape on your computer.
2. **New Document:** Create a new document (File > New).
3. **Document Properties:**
    * Go to File > Document Properties (or press `Shift + Ctrl + D`).
    * **Units:** Set the "Display units" to centimeters (cm).
    * **Page Size:** Choose a page size that is big enough for all blocks, for example A3.
    * **Scale** Make sure the scale is 1.
4. **Add Guides**: Add vertical and horizontal guides to the canvas, to help you organize the blocks. You can add the guides by clicking on the left ruler, and dragging it to the canvas. Do the same with the upper ruler to add horizontal guides.

### Step 2: Creating the Base Block (Block 1)

1. **Rectangle Tool:** Select the Rectangle tool (`R` key).
2. **Draw the Rectangle:** Draw a rectangle on the canvas. Don't worry about the exact size yet.
3. **Set Dimensions:**
    * Select the rectangle.
    * In the tool controls bar at the top, set the following:
        * **Width (W):** 2cm (or 2,5cm)
        * **Height (H):** 2cm (or 2,5cm)
    * You should also fill the block with a colour.

### Step 3: Creating Blocks 2-10 and Adding Numbers

This step combines the creation of the remaining blocks and the addition of the numbers to each block.

1. **Create the Number:**
    * **Text Tool:** Select the Text tool (`T` key).
    * **Add Text:** Click on the canvas and type `2`. This will be the number for Block 2.
    * **Font and style:** Choose the font and style of the number.
    * **Convert to Path**: Select the number, and go to Path > Object to path (`Ctrl + Shift + C`).
2. **Create Block 2:**
    * **Select the number**: Select the number 2, now converted to path.
    * **Duplicate Block 1:** Select the base block (Block 1) and duplicate it using `Ctrl + D`.
    * **Adjust Width:** Select the duplicated block. Now select the number 2 and the duplicated block. Click in "align and distribute" (`Ctrl + Shift +A`). Select "Align left edges" and "Align top edges". Now, resize the duplicated block until it is the same length than the number 2, and the end of the number is at the end of the block.
    * You can change the colour of the block.
    * **Position the Number:** Select the number and the block. Go to Object > Align and Distribute (or `Ctrl + Shift + A`). In the "Align and Distribute" panel, select both "Center on vertical axis" and "Center on horizontal axis".
3. **Repeat for Blocks 3-10:**
    * Repeat steps 1 and 2 for blocks 3 through 10.
    * Each time, create the number, and use it as a reference for the size of the block.
    * Create each block in order.
    * You should change the colour for each block.
4. **Organize**: Organize the blocks in the canvas. You can use the guides to do so.

### Step 4: Cutting Lines

1. **Select all Blocks:** Select all the blocks.
2. **Stroke style**: In the Fill and Stroke panel (`Ctrl+Shift+F`), go to "Stroke style". Select the correct width. This may change depending on your material thickness (if you material is 3mm thick, the line should be 0,3mm).
3. **Change the color**: Now, change the stroke color to the color your machine uses to cut.

### Step 5: Organizing and Arranging

1. **Arrange on Canvas:** Arrange the blocks on your Inkscape canvas in a way that maximizes space and efficiency for laser cutting or CNC milling.
2. **Spacing:** Leave a small amount of space between blocks to allow for material removal and avoid burning edges, depending on the machine you will use.

### Step 6: Saving the File

1. **Save as SVG:** Go to File > Save As.
2. **File Type:** Choose "Plain SVG" as the file type.
3. **File Name:** Give your file a descriptive name (e.g., `montessori-number-blocks.svg`).
4. **Save:** Click "Save."
5. **Save as DXF:** Go to File > Save a Copy.
6. **File Type:** Choose "Desktop Cutting Plotter (AutoCAD DXF R14) (*.dxf)".
7. **File Name:** Give your file a descriptive name (e.g., `montessori-number-blocks.dxf`).
8. **Save:** Click "Save."

## Tips and Considerations

* **Kerf:** If you're laser cutting, consider the kerf (the width of the material removed by the laser). You might need to adjust the dimensions slightly to account for this.
* **Material thickness:** You need to adapt the design depending on the material thickness you are using.
* **Testing:** Always test a small sample cut with your specific material and machine settings before cutting the entire set of blocks.
* **Engraving:** If you want to engrave the numbers, you'll need to create a separate layer or color for the numbers that tells the machine to engrave instead of cut.
* **Optimization:** You can make the most of the machine space, by duplicating all the designs.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can design your own Montessori Numeric Blocks using Inkscape. These blocks are a fantastic tool for teaching children about numbers and mathematics. Remember to take your time, test your designs, and have fun with it!
