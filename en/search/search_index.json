License grant.</p> <pre><code>   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n      the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n      non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n      exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n        a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n           in part; and\n\n        b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n      License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n      its terms and conditions.\n\n   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n      6(a).\n\n   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n      Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n      all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n      and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n      Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n      authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n      necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n      technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n      Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n      simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n      (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n   5. Downstream recipients.\n\n        a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n           recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n           receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n           Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n           Public License.\n\n        b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.\n           Every recipient of Adapted Material from You\n           automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to\n           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material\n           under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n        c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n           any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n           apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n           Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n           Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n           Material.\n\n   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n      may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n      are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n      with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n      the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n      provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n</code></pre> <p>b. Other rights.</p> <pre><code>   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n      licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n      privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n      the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n      assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n      extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n      Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n      Public License.\n\n   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n      collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n      Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n      under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n      licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n      reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n</code></pre> <p>Section 3 -- License Conditions.</p> <p>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.</p> <p>a.

You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms\n      or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\n      Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the\n      rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n</code></pre> <p>Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.</p> <p>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:</p> <p>a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial      portion of the contents of the database;</p> <p>b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,      including for purposes of Section 3(b); and</p> <p>c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</p> <p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.</p> <p>Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</p> <p>a.

For example, the \"1\" block is the smallest, while the \"10\" block is the largest. This allows children to visually grasp the concept of quantity.</li> <li>Versatility: They can be used for a variety of activities, including:</li> <li>Counting and Number Recognition: Learning number names and their sequence.</li> <li>Number Sense: Understanding the relative value of numbers (e.g., 5 is bigger than 3).</li> <li>Addition and Subtraction: Physically combining or taking away blocks to visualize basic operations.</li> <li>Place Value: Laying the groundwork for understanding units, tens, and hundreds.</li> </ul> <p>Benefits of using Montessori numeric blocks:</p> <ul> <li>Concrete Learning: Provides a tangible representation of abstract numbers.</li> <li>Visual Learning: Helps children \"see\" mathematical concepts.</li> <li>Self-Correction: The proportional sizing allows children to check their own work.
