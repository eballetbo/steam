# Open STEAM Education Resources

Welcome to the Open STEAM Education Resources repository! This project aims to provide high-quality, freely accessible educational materials for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM).

## Our Mission

Our mission is to foster a culture of open education by creating and sharing resources that empower learners of all ages. We believe that education should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or location. By embracing the principles of open education, we strive to:

* **Promote Access:** Make STEAM education resources available to a global audience.
* **Encourage Collaboration:** Invite educators and learners to contribute, adapt, and improve the resources.
* **Support Innovation:** Provide tools and materials that inspire creativity and critical thinking.
* **Foster Equity:** Ensure that educational opportunities are not limited by economic or social barriers.

## What is Open Education?

Open education is a philosophy that promotes the free sharing and use of educational resources. It is based on the idea that knowledge should be a public good, and that everyone should have the opportunity to learn and grow. Key principles of open education include:

* **Open Access:** Resources are freely available online.
* **Open Licensing:** Resources are shared under licenses that allow for reuse, adaptation, and distribution.
* **Collaboration:** Educators and learners work together to create and improve resources.
* **Inclusivity:** Open education aims to break down barriers to learning and create a more equitable educational landscape.
