# Number Towers

**Objective:** Learn to solve addition and subtraction problems using number blocks in a visual and practical way.

**Materials:** Montessori Number Blocks (1 to 10)

**Instructions:**

1.  **Exploration:** Observe and order the blocks.
2.  **Building Towers:** Combine blocks to represent addition (3 + 2 = 5).
3.  **Addition Problems:** Solve simple addition problems by building towers. For example:
    * 2 + 4 = ?
    * 5 + 3 = ?
    * 1 + 6 = ?
4.  **Subtraction Problems:** Solve subtraction problems by removing blocks from taller towers. For example:
    * 6 - 2 = ?
    * 9 - 4 = ?
    * 5 - 1 = ?
5.  **Challenge Game:** Find combinations that add up to a specific number. For example: "Find two towers that add up to 8."
